One of the testing principles states that exhaustive testing is impossible. It can be misleading though as it is natural coming to a conclusion that if exhaustive testing is impossible there's no point in reaching it. So, the question arises: Do we need to increase our testing to the maximum possible extent? Do we need to try in attempting the situation where n(tests) -> âˆž ? The answer can be trickier to answer than it seems. So, let's try to discuss pros and cons of trying to reach such state of testing that we can say about them being exhaustive.

Exhaustive means complete, full, comprehensive, including all possibilities (by Mariam-Webster dictionary). 
Technopedia defines exhaustive testing as a testing or quality assurance approach in which all possible combinations of scenarios and use/test cases are used for testing. what do we mean by all possible combinations?
Let's say we speak about word processor. It definitely makes no sense trying to test every possible input as obviously their combinations goes straight to infinity (well not exactly). If we take Google docs for example it allows up to 1.02 million characters per document. if we assume that UTF-8 is used in Google Docs it's up to 1.1 million symbols (not all of them used I know), let's take that 65536 chars are used in Google Docs, so we can have up to 1020000!/(1020000 - 65536)! cases or
